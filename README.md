**Image Classification with Keras**

This project demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using Keras, a high-level deep learning library. The model is trained to classify images into sad and happy faces. Happy images are classified as 0 and sad images are classified as 1. Hence predict function returning 0 to 0.5 is signalling to happy faces and 0.5 to 1 is signalling to sad faces. 

**Project Structure**

The project structure is organized as follows:

data/: This directory contains the dataset for training and evaluation. It is recommended to split the dataset into separate folders for training and testing/validation.

models/: This directory contains the saved trained models or checkpoints.

logs/: Logs generated by tensorboard to evaluate model's performance. Pleas refer to the notebook for the output.
